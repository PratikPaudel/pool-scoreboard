# 🎱 Pool Game Score Tracker & Prediction App

## 📜 Our Story
> Over the past three years, my roommate Nick and I have shared countless pool matches, turning our friendly rivalry into a cherished part of our daily lives. Wanting to move beyond our old whiteboard scorekeeping and involve Nick's family in our games, I decided to create this web app that's become so much more than a simple score tracker. Built with React and Next.js, my app not only keeps our scores but lets our friends and Nick's family predict our match outcomes, bringing everyone closer to our friendly competition.
